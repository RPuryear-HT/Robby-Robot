Description: Create multiple base users, set OU, network folder, on-prem mailbox & add to the desired groups.
==============================================================================================================================
Note: Requires manual editing. You can add an 'if' or 'match' statement to any step in order to apply to your specific user 
types. No one script can fulfill everyone's needs, so customize this for your environment. Account credentials must have 
Active Directory Object, file server and Exchange Online admin permissions. Requires a list of users located at 
C:\scripts\baseusers.txt and passwords at C:\scripts\passwords.txt. Place as many passwords as you like and one will be chosen 
at random. This will take seconds up to several minutes to run depending on the user/group count. Please wait for script 
completion messages. Use at your own risk.
